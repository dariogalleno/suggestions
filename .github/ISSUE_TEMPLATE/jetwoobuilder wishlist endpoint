Hi there,
1st of all tks for you great plugin suite.
it will be great if in jetwoobuilder should be also the wishlist endpoint.
This feature will improve UX as the customer will check whislist product in its account
Also it will avoid to set up the specific query in query builder + public user meta stores , and use the same wishlist widget as per the wishlist page.

hope this will make sens
many tks in advance for your help and integration.
Dario
