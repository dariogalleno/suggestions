Hi there,
1st of all tks for you great plugin suite.
it will be great if in jetwoobuilder should be also the wishlist endpoint.
this feature will get a better UX as the customer will check products added in its user account 
it will avoid to set up the specific query in query builder + public user meta stores , and use the same wishlist widget as per the wishlist page.

hope this will make sens
many tks in advance for your help and integration.
Dario
